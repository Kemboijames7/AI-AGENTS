# AI-AGENTS

## Tab 1 
Meaning covers the formal definition, the 4 pillars (Perceive → Reason → Act → Loop), and a clear comparison table showing how agents differ from regular AI models.
## Tab 2 
Analogy uses two vivid real-world comparisons: a personal assistant booking your flight autonomously, and a contractor renovating your kitchen — step by step — to make the concept click intuitively.
## Tab 3 
Live Demo is the most fun: pick a preset task (or write your own), hit Run Agent, and watch the agent's internal Thought → Action → Observation loop animate in real time, with tool highlights and a loop visualizer. Try all four presets — they each run a completely different scenario (research, finance calculation, coding + email, weather).
